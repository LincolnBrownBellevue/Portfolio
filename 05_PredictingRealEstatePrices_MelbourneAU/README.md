## Predicing Real Estate Prices in Melbourne, AU

## Overview

This project analyzes the Melbourne housing market using a dataset that includes various features such as price, location, property type, and other characteristics. The goal is to uncover trends, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build predictive models for housing prices. 

## Requirements

<ul>
  <li>folium - for interactive maps.</li>
  <li>geopandas - for working with geospatial data.</li>
  <li>json - for working with JSON data.</li>
  <li>matplotlib - for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.</li>
  <li>numpy - for numerical operations and working with arrays.</li>
  <li>pandas - for data manipulation and analysis.</li>
  <li>plotly - for creating interactive plots and dashboards.</li>
  <li>seaborn - for statistical data visualization.</li>
  <li>scipy - for scientific and technical computing (used for statistical functions like shapiro, skew, kurtosis, and zscore).</li>
  <li>shapely - for manipulation and analysis of geometric objects.</li>
  <li>scikit-learn - for machine learning tools (used for clustering, regression, feature selection, model evaluation, cross-validation, and preprocessing).</li>
  <li>xgboost - for gradient boosting and machine learning tasks.</li>
</ul>

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project includeS:
<ul>
    <li>Summary statistics and missing value handling</li>
    <li>Data visualization including distribution plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps</li>
    <li>Feature engineering and data processing</li>
</ul>

## Machine Learning Models:

Predictive models include:
<ul>
    <li>Linear Regression</li>
    <li>Random Forest Regressor</li>
    <li>Gradient Boosting Machines</li>
</ul>

Evaluation metrics used:
<ul>
    <li>Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</li>
    <li>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)</li>
    <li>R-Squared(RÂ²)</li>
</ul>

## Results and Findings
<ul>
    <li>The dataset contains missing values in features like BuildingArea and YearBuilt, requiring imputation.</li>
    <li>Property prices are influenced significantly by location, number of rooms, and land size</li>
    <li>Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models outperform Linear Regression in predictive accuracy</li>

</ul>
