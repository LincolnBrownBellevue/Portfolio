## Loan Approval Prediction

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook contains an analysis of loan approval prediction using machine learning techniques.
The dataset includes applicant attributes including income, education, credit history, and property area.
The goal of this project is to preprocess the data, apply classification models, and determine the best-performing model for predicting loan approval status. 

## Requirements
<ul>
    <li> pandas </li>
    <li>numpy</li>
    <li>scikit-learn</li>
    <li>matplotlib.pyplot</li>

</ul>

## Findings

This project successfully builds and evaluates a machine learning pipeline for loan approval prediction. 
Key results include:
<ul> 
    <li>The initial KNN model achieved an acurracy score of 78.13%</ul>
    <li>Hyperparameter tuning improved the accuracy to 79.17% with n_neighbors=3</li>
    <li>Additional classifiers, including Logsitic Regression and Random Forest, were tested to identify potential improvements</li>

This project highlights the importance of data preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning in predictive analytics.Future work could involve additional feature engineering and/or deep learning models for improved performance.
